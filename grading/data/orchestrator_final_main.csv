SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

This activity is significant as PsExec is often used by threat actors for remote code execution, and the `accepteula` flag indicates first-time usage, which could signify an initial compromise. The detection occurred between Jul 12, 2024 08:10 AM UTC and Jul 12, 2024 09:10 AM UTC, with a high severity level. The user involved was ""Administrator,"" and the risk score for the system was 8855.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques for Lateral Movement, specifically Remote Services (T1021) and SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002). These activities suggest an attempt to move laterally within the network, potentially leading to further system compromise. Actionable steps include monitoring remote login events, associated SMB activity, and the actions of remote users who connect to administrative shares.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'finding_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is splunk?'}]",What is splunk?,conversation_response,conversation_response,poc,{'skill_name': 'conversation_response'},"name='conversation_response' arguments={'intent': 'What is splunk?'} contexts={<class 'pipeline.contexts.tools.ToolsContext'>: [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'findings_summarizer', 'description': 'Findings Summarizer skill is built for ""summarizing"" or in other words ""explaining"" the findings found in an investigation.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

The activity was detected on the system ""win-dc.attackrange.local"" and was executed by the user ""Administrator"". The use of BITSAdmin in this manner is significant as it can be exploited to download and execute malicious files without immediate detection, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment. The severity of this finding is high, indicating a substantial risk to the system.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, including Command and Control, Defense Evasion, and Persistence. Specifically, the techniques BITS Jobs (T1197) and Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) were observed. These activities suggest an adversary may be attempting to establish persistent access or transfer tools into the environment, which could lead to further exploitation or data exfiltration. Monitoring BITSAdmin usage and network activity for unusual patterns is recommended as a next step.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'finding_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What does this finding mean {\n  ""event_id"": ""SEC23456"",\n  ""event_time"": ""2023-09-22T14:32:01Z"",\n  ""event_type"": ""Failed Login Detection"",\n  ""source"": ""Firewall_Log"",\n  ""src_ip"": ""192.168.1.10"",\n  ""dest_ip"": ""192.168.1.100"",\n  ""user"": ""john.doe"",\n  ""app"": ""SSH"",\n  ""severity"": ""High"",\n  ""status"": ""New"",\n  ""description"": ""Multiple failed login attempts detected within a short time frame."",\n  ""action_required"": ""Investigate the source IP and affected user account.

The risk score of 165 exceeded the threshold of 100, indicating significant potential threats. The findings include various MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques such as Remote Services, System Information Discovery, and Impair Defenses, suggesting attempts to evade defenses, gather system information, and move laterally within the network.

The severity of this finding is medium, and it warrants further investigation to determine the intent and prevent potential damage.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe identified activity aligns with the Command and Control tactic (TA0011) and the Uncommonly High AWS Instances Terminated technique (T1065). These activities suggest an attempt to disrupt or control cloud resources, which could be part of a larger attack strategy.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

This behavior is often associated with obfuscation techniques used by attackers to hide malicious commands or payloads. The detected activity occurred on Jul 12, 2024, and was flagged as high severity due to its potential to allow unauthorized command execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The source of the detection was the ""ESCU - Linux Decode Base64 to Shell - Rule,"" which monitors for such patterns.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with MITRE ATT&CK tactics for Defense Evasion and Execution, specifically techniques T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) and T1059.004 (Unix Shell). These activities suggest an attempt to evade detection and execute unauthorized commands, indicating a potential compromise that requires immediate attention to prevent further malicious actions.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'write SPL to look at events in _internal index in last 15 minutes'}]",write SPL to look at events in _internal index in last 15 minutes,spl_writer,spl_writer,staging,"{'skill_name': '### spl_writer Output:\n```\nindex=_internal earliest=-15m \n```\nNote: ""_internal"" is used to index internal logs of splunk and earliest = -15m will return only the results that are 15 minutes old or newer.'}",name='spl_writer' arguments={'intent': 'This SPL query looks at events in _internal index in last 15 minutes.'} contexts={},1,,,,,5719,"[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate investigation report'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '### investigation_report Output:\n\nInvestigation Final Report\n\nTitle:\nMalicious PowerShell Process With Obfuscation Techniques\n\nReport Date: \nAug 05, 2024 UTC\n\nReport Number: \nMC-00020-2024-08-05-15-30-00\n\nInvestigation Commander: \nSplunk Administrator\n\nInvestigation Number: \nMC-00020\n\nInvestigation Urgency: \nHigh\n\nTimeline of activity\n\nTime of First Activity: \nJul 03, 2024 05:35 AM UTC\n\nInvestigation Discovery: \nJul 03, 2024 06:43 AM UTC\n\nInvestigation Resolution: \nin-progress\n\nInvestigation Summary: \nThe investigation identified a malicious PowerShell process using obfuscation techniques.

This behavior is often associated with obfuscation techniques used by attackers to hide malicious commands or payloads. The detected activity occurred on Jul 12, 2024, and was flagged as high severity due to its potential to allow unauthorized command execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The source of the detection was the ""ESCU - Linux Decode Base64 to Shell - Rule,"" which monitors for such patterns.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with MITRE ATT&CK tactics for Defense Evasion and Execution, specifically techniques T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) and T1059.004 (Unix Shell). These activities suggest an attempt to evade detection and execute unauthorized commands, indicating a potential compromise that requires immediate attention to prevent further malicious actions.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'write SPL to look at events in _internal index in last 15 minutes'}]",spl_writer,6.755274057,spl_writer,spl_writer,spl_writer,5.674988031,spl_writer,spl_writer,4.268023968,spl_writer,spl_writer,4.212635279,write spl look event internal index last 15 minute

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions.

The severity of this finding is high, indicating a substantial risk to the system.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, including Command and Control, Defense Evasion, and Persistence. Specifically, the techniques BITS Jobs (T1197) and Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) were observed. These activities suggest an adversary may be attempting to establish persistent access or transfer tools into the environment, which could lead to further exploitation or data exfiltration. Monitoring BITSAdmin usage and network activity for unusual patterns is recommended as a next step.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generated spl search index=_internal earliest=-2d did not produce any results'}]",conversation_response,6.658150911,conversation_response,conversation_response,conversation_response,5.589552164,conversation_response,conversation_response,4.095814228,conversation_response,conversation_response,4.081877947,generated spl search indexinternal earliest2d produce result

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

Monitoring for unexpected processes interacting with LSASS and implementing additional logging features for process execution can help mitigate these risks.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Summarize the findings'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '### findings_summarizer Output:\n\n| **Field**                  | **Value**                         |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Investigation Name**     | ATT&CK tactic threshold exceeded over previous 7 days for system=linux-svr1 |\n| **Timeframe**              | Jul 05, 2024 07:30 AM UTC - Jul 12, 2024 11:02 AM UTC |\n| **Risk Object**            | linux-svr1 |\n| **Severity**               | high |\n| **MITRE ATT&CK Tactic**    | Credential Access (TA0006) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/) |\n|                            | Defense Evasion (TA0005) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/) |\n|                            | Execution (TA0002) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/) |\n|                            | Persistence (TA0003) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003/) |\n|                            | Privilege Escalation (TA0004) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004/) |\n| **MITRE ATT&CK Technique** | OS Credential Dumping (T1003) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) |\n|                            | /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow (T1003.008) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/008) |\n|                            | Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) |\n|                            | Unix Shell (T1059.004) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004) |\n|                            | File and Directory Permissions Modification (T1222) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222) |\n|                            | Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification (T1222.002) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002) |\n|                            | Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547) |\n|                            | Kernel Modules and Extensions (T1547.006) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006) |\n|                            | Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548) |\n|                            | Sudo and Sudo Caching (T1548.003) (hXXps://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003) |\n| **Original Source**        | ESCU - Linux Change File Owner To Root - Rule |\n\n**Understanding the Findings:**\nThe investigation ""ATT&CK tactic threshold exceeded over previous 7 days for system=linux-svr1"" identified multiple high-severity activities on the system ""linux-svr1"" from Jul 05, 2024 07:30 AM UTC to Jul 12, 2024 11:02 AM UTC. The findings include various MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, indicating potential credential dumping, obfuscation, privilege escalation, and persistence mechanisms. The original detection sources include rules related to changing file ownership to root, decoding Base64 to shell, and installing kernel modules. These activities suggest a sophisticated attempt to gain and maintain unauthorized access to the system.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe identified MITRE tactics and techniques indicate a comprehensive attack strategy involving credential access, defense evasion, execution, persistence, and privilege escalation. Immediate actions should include reviewing and securing credential storage, monitoring for obfuscated files, and ensuring proper file and directory permissions. These activities suggest an adversary is attempting to establish and maintain control over the system, potentially leading to further exploitation or data exfiltration.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'No, I asked for SPL that lists the name of every index in the system'}]",spl_writer,7.256277084,spl_writer,spl_writer,spl_writer,6.192928076,spl_writer,spl_writer,4.677168131,spl_writer,spl_writer,4.750423908,asked spl list name every index system

This activity was detected on Jun 26, 2024, and is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic Credential Access and technique Account Manipulation. The severity of this finding is currently unknown. The detection originated from the AWS CloudTrail logs and was flagged by the rule ""Threat - DMOESS9004 - Hybrid - Create Notable Equals True - Rule.""\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe activity falls under the MITRE ATT&CK tactic Credential Access (TA0006) and technique Account Manipulation (T1098). This suggests that the user may be attempting to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence within the AWS environment. Immediate action should be taken to review and potentially revoke the IAM Key created by \'jwilkinson\' to prevent any unauthorized access.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'generate a SPL to investigate'}]",spl_writer,7.315877199,spl_writer,spl_writer,The provided function definitions are not suitable for this task.

The detection occurred between Jul 12, 2024 08:10 AM UTC and Jul 12, 2024 09:10 AM UTC, with a high severity level. The user involved was ""Administrator,"" and the risk score for the system was 8855.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques for Lateral Movement, specifically Remote Services (T1021) and SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002). These activities suggest an attempt to move laterally within the network, potentially leading to further system compromise.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions.

This activity was detected on Jul 10, 2024, and poses a significant security risk as it can expose sensitive credentials. The detection was triggered by the use of specific command-line arguments associated with procdump.exe, indicating potential credential dumping. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within the network.\n\n** MITRE Analysis **\nThe findings align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Credential Access tactic (TA0006) and techniques OS Credential Dumping (T1003) and LSASS Memory (T1003.001). These activities suggest an attempt to harvest credentials from the LSASS process, which could be used for further malicious actions such as lateral movement and privilege escalation. Monitoring for unexpected processes interacting with LSASS and implementing additional logging features for process execution can help mitigate these risks.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate investigation report'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Investigation Final Report\n\nTitle:\nThreat - DMOESS9004 - Hybrid - Create Notable Equals True - Rule\n\nReport Date: \nAug 05, 2024 UTC\n\nReport Number: \nMC-00005-2024-08-05-15-16-00\n\nInvestigation Commander: \nSplunk Administrator\n\nInvestigation Number: \nMC-00005\n\nInvestigation Urgency: \nLow\n\nTimeline of activity \n\nTime of First Activity: \nJun 26, 2024 08:17 AM UTC\n\nInvestigation Discovery: \nJun 29, 2024 12:47 AM UTC\n\nInvestigation Resolution: \nAug 23, 2024 01:17 PM UTC\n\nInvestigation Summary: \nThe investigation was triggered by an alert indicating that the user hnoboru mounted an ISO image to the host PF2YGFYF.

This activity was detected on Jul 10, 2024, and poses a significant security risk as it can expose sensitive credentials. The detection was triggered by the use of specific command-line arguments associated with procdump.exe, indicating potential credential dumping. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within the network.\n\n** MITRE Analysis **\nThe findings align with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically under the Credential Access tactic (TA0006) and techniques OS Credential Dumping (T1003) and LSASS Memory (T1003.001). These activities suggest an attempt to harvest credentials from the LSASS process, which could be used for further malicious actions such as lateral movement and privilege escalation. Monitoring for unexpected processes interacting with LSASS and implementing additional logging features for process execution can help mitigate these risks.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate investigation report'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '### investigation_report Output:\n\nInvestigation Final Report\n\nTitle:\nThreat - DMOESS9004 - Hybrid - Create Notable Equals True - Rule\n\nReport Date: \nAug 05, 2024 UTC\n\nReport Number: \nMC-00005-2024-08-05-15-16-00\n\nInvestigation Commander: \nSplunk Administrator\n\nInvestigation Number: \nMC-00005\n\nInvestigation Urgency: \nLow\n\nTimeline of activity \n\nTime of First Activity: \nJun 26, 2024 08:17 AM UTC\n\nInvestigation Discovery: \nJun 29, 2024 12:47 AM UTC\n\nInvestigation Resolution: \nAug 23, 2024 01:17 PM UTC\n\nInvestigation Summary: \nThe investigation was triggered by an alert indicating that the user hnoboru mounted an ISO image to the host PF2YGFYF.

The findings include various MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, indicating potential credential dumping, obfuscation, privilege escalation, and persistence mechanisms. The original detection sources include rules related to changing file ownership to root, decoding Base64 to shell, and installing kernel modules. These activities suggest a sophisticated attempt to gain and maintain unauthorized access to the system.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe identified MITRE tactics and techniques indicate a comprehensive attack strategy involving credential access, defense evasion, execution, persistence, and privilege escalation. Immediate actions should include reviewing and securing credential storage, monitoring for obfuscated files, and ensuring proper file and directory permissions. These activities suggest an adversary is attempting to establish and maintain control over the system, potentially leading to further exploitation or data exfiltration.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Summarize the findings'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '| **Field**                  | **Value**                         |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Investigation Name**     | risk_score_mv_incident            |\n| **Timeframe**              |                                   |\n| **Risk Object**            |                                   |\n| **Severity**               |                                   |\n| **MITRE ATT&CK Tactic**    |                                   |\n| **MITRE ATT&CK Technique** |                                   |\n| **Original Source**        |                                   |\n\n**Understanding the Findings:**\nNo Splunk Finding was provided.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Explain credential dumping'}]",Explain credential dumping,conversation_response,spl_writer,prod,,"name='conversation_response' arguments={'intent': 'Explain credential dumping'} contexts={<class 'pipeline.contexts.tools.ToolsContext'>: [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'findings_summarizer', 'description': 'Findings Summarizer skill is built for ""summarizing"" or in other words ""explaining"" the findings found in an investigation.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

These activities suggest potential credential access, defense evasion, and privilege escalation attempts. The original detection sources include rules for BITSAdmin file downloads and malicious PowerShell processes.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe identified MITRE tactics and techniques indicate a sophisticated attack involving credential dumping, command and scripting interpreter abuse, and registry modifications. These activities suggest an adversary attempting to gain and maintain elevated privileges, execute malicious code, and gather system information. Immediate actions should include reviewing and mitigating the identified techniques, enhancing monitoring, and conducting a thorough investigation to identify and remove any persistent threats.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Generate investigation report'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'In-Progress Investigation Summary\n\nTitle:\nDump LSASS via procdump\n\nReport Date: \nAug 05, 2024 UTC\n\nReport Number: \nMC-00019-2024-08-05-15-33-00\n\nInvestigation Commander: \nadmin\n\nInvestigation Number: \nMC-00019\n\nInvestigation Urgency: \nMedium\n\nTimeline of activity \n\nTime of First Activity: \nJul 10, 2024 11:26 PM UTC\n\nInvestigation Discovery: \nJul 10, 2024 11:26 PM UTC\n\nInvestigation Resolution: \nin-progress\n\nInvestigation Summary: \nThe investigation focuses on detecting the use of procdump.exe to dump the LSASS process, which can expose sensitive credentials.

The original detection sources include rules for BITSAdmin file downloads and malicious PowerShell processes.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe identified MITRE tactics and techniques indicate a sophisticated attack involving credential dumping, command and scripting interpreter abuse, and registry modifications. These activities suggest an adversary attempting to gain and maintain elevated privileges, execute malicious code, and gather system information. Immediate actions should include reviewing and mitigating the identified techniques, enhancing monitoring, and conducting a thorough investigation to identify and remove any persistent threats.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'findings_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'how many findings are there in this investigation'}]",conversation_response,11.15953398,conversation_response,conversation_response,conversation_response,6.243779182,conversation_response,conversation_response,4.779026031,conversation_response,conversation_response,4.823441744,many finding investigation
