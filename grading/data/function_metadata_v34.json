In addition, it pulls important affected/compromised assents and entities from the input data and displays these as a list. It summarizes the main MITRE tactics and techniques involved as well as gives high level summary of analyst work notes. Finally, it gives a chronological timeline of events associated with the incident including the dates, times and descriptions of activity for investigation creation, finding discovery and notes being added by the analyst.",
