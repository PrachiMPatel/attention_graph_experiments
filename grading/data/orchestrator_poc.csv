SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

This activity is significant as PsExec is often used by threat actors for remote code execution, and the `accepteula` flag indicates first-time usage, which could signify an initial compromise. The detection occurred between Jul 12, 2024 08:10 AM UTC and Jul 12, 2024 09:10 AM UTC, with a high severity level. The user involved was ""Administrator,"" and the risk score for the system was 8855.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with the MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques for Lateral Movement, specifically Remote Services (T1021) and SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002). These activities suggest an attempt to move laterally within the network, potentially leading to further system compromise. Actionable steps include monitoring remote login events, associated SMB activity, and the actions of remote users who connect to administrative shares.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'finding_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is splunk?'}]",What is splunk?,conversation_response,conversation_response,poc,{'skill_name': 'conversation_response'},"name='conversation_response' arguments={'intent': 'What is splunk?'} contexts={<class 'pipeline.contexts.tools.ToolsContext'>: [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'findings_summarizer', 'description': 'Findings Summarizer skill is built for ""summarizing"" or in other words ""explaining"" the findings found in an investigation.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

The activity was detected on the system ""win-dc.attackrange.local"" and was executed by the user ""Administrator"". The use of BITSAdmin in this manner is significant as it can be exploited to download and execute malicious files without immediate detection, potentially leading to code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment. The severity of this finding is high, indicating a substantial risk to the system.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe findings align with several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, including Command and Control, Defense Evasion, and Persistence. Specifically, the techniques BITS Jobs (T1197) and Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) were observed. These activities suggest an adversary may be attempting to establish persistent access or transfer tools into the environment, which could lead to further exploitation or data exfiltration. Monitoring BITSAdmin usage and network activity for unusual patterns is recommended as a next step.\n\nThis is an AI generated summary of the available information, and further investigation may be required to fully understand the finding.', 'skill_name': 'finding_summarizer'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What does this finding mean {\n  ""event_id"": ""SEC23456"",\n  ""event_time"": ""2023-09-22T14:32:01Z"",\n  ""event_type"": ""Failed Login Detection"",\n  ""source"": ""Firewall_Log"",\n  ""src_ip"": ""192.168.1.10"",\n  ""dest_ip"": ""192.168.1.100"",\n  ""user"": ""john.doe"",\n  ""app"": ""SSH"",\n  ""severity"": ""High"",\n  ""status"": ""New"",\n  ""description"": ""Multiple failed login attempts detected within a short time frame."",\n  ""action_required"": ""Investigate the source IP and affected user account.

The risk score of 165 exceeded the threshold of 100, indicating significant potential threats. The findings include various MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques such as Remote Services, System Information Discovery, and Impair Defenses, suggesting attempts to evade defenses, gather system information, and move laterally within the network.

The severity of this finding is medium, and it warrants further investigation to determine the intent and prevent potential damage.\n\n**MITRE Analysis**\nThe identified activity aligns with the Command and Control tactic (TA0011) and the Uncommonly High AWS Instances Terminated technique (T1065). These activities suggest an attempt to disrupt or control cloud resources, which could be part of a larger attack strategy.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.

SPL can access Splunk data like logs, raw events, host telemetry, emails, users, and much more.\n  example user requests:\n    - Write spl to list available source_types.\n    - Find the user accounts associated with failed login attempts.\n    - Spl query to see high risk events in last 24hrs.\n    - Write SPL to list all indices\n    - Update the SPL to use host=localhost\n    - How many events are in the main index\n    - Who has signed into host abc in the last 2 days\n\n2) Provides a concise summary of security findings. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Summarize the [alert/investigation].\n    - Give a short description of all findings.\n    - Summarize findings.\n    - Explain the Findings.\n    - Explain the Findings of this investigation.\n    - What are the findings in this investigation?\n    - Give me the summary of this finding.\n    - Generate the summary of these findings.\n    - What do the findings in this investigation show?\n    - What do the findings in this investigation say?\n\n3) Creates detailed reports of investigations, including event timelines and comprehensive information. Note: This tool generates static summaries, which are generally consistent throughout the session.\n  example user requests:\n    - Give me the details about this incident.\n    - List all findings for a given incident.\n    - Generate investigation report\n    - report\n    - give me the report\n    - give me timeline of events\n    - generate timeline for this investigation\n\nYou also have access to a system tools:\n4) Responds to user queries about investigation objects, chat history references, or general questions. The conversation skill can also answer questions about the investigation’s object fields, such as:\n\t•\tcreate_time, update_time, id, description, incident_type, status, assignee, urgency, sensitivity, and others.\n  example user requests:\n    - What are your skills?\n    - What does spl mean?\n    - How do i write an investigation report?\n    - What is a finding in the context of Splunk?\n    - What does this spl query mean?\n    - What is the urgency of this investigation?\n    - Who is the assignee for this case?\n\nIf the Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit, still summarize what you did so far.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `splunk_spl_writer tool` to write SPL.\nYou MUST ALWAYS use the `conversation_response` to respond to user requests if no other skill applies.\nDo not include optional arguments in the tool call if their value is not in query or chat history.
